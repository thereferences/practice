# Technologies & Development Practice

Guidelines for

* The design, development, and/or deployment of machine learning components that **(a)** are in-line with software
  engineering, i.e., programming, best practices, **(b)** are secure, **\(c\)** are available, reliable, maintainable, and
  resilient, and **(d)** seamlessly integrate with overarching products.  The development practices section outlines team,
  and best, practices vis-Ã -vis the engineering aspects of model development.

* Operating, developing, within secure continuous integration, deployment, and delivery settings.

* Online Notes: We will use Sphinx, and specifically the Sphinx Book Theme.  A template repository is being finalised.
