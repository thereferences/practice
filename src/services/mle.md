## Focus

In brief:

* **Modelling**. Develop models in-line with model development best practices, including in-depth collaborations
  with domain experts, which ensures the development of well-informed models.

* **The Machine Learning Model Component of a Product**. Design, develop, and/or deploy machine learning components that 
  are (a) in-line with software engineering, i.e., programming, best practices, (b) secure, \(c\) available, reliable, 
  maintainable, and resilient, and (d) seamlessly integrate into the overarching product.  The development practices section outlines team, and best, practices vis-Ã -vis the engineering aspects of 
  model development.

## Service

Please address service requests via the upcoming services management hub.  The team's services launch blog will include an introduction to the hub.  Before proceeding with a machine learning engineering service ascertain that it is a component of an in-progress project:

> That (a) addresses a business problem, (b) has an unambiguous problem statement, (c) has a deployment goal, (d) has a 
> machine learning model prediction/forecast/diagnostic aim, (e) is technologically feasible and economically viable.

Additionally, rigorously evaluate

* Model requirements
* Team capacity

<br>

## Project Management

Each machine learning engineering project must have either (a) a JIRA Project, or (b) GitHub Project.
