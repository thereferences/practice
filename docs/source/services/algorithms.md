# Machine Learning Algorithms Inquiries

## Focus

In brief:

> Efficiently address questions, but the priority is in-depth and unambiguous explanations.

Never use the phrase ``research shows that''; if a study or paper has an excellent explanation share the source details.

<br>

## Service

In future, algorithms inquiries will be addressed via a services/inquiries management hub.  A future blog will include an introduction to the hub, and will outline how colleagues and clients can use it.
