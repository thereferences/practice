# About

These pages continuously outline the data science team's operating practices vis-Ã -vis:

<ul class="disc">
  <li class="disc">serving clients</li>
  <li class="disc">designing, developing, and deploying solutions, i.e., development practices</li>
</ul>

The pages ensure that we have the same understanding of the team's practices; the pages will be updated continuously, therefore each team member must study the pages often.
