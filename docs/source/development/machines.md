All the organisation's computer usage rules apply; remember, Universal Serial Bus (USB) sticks are disallowed.

<br>

**Initial Set-up**

Foremost:

* Do not select Microsoft Account.  Instead, select the **School/Business** option, thereafter select **other domains** option.
* Install and set-up the security software.
* Hard Drive Partitioning: Consider partitioning the C drive into two drives; such that the second drive is for development purposes.

<br>

Additionally, install

* [firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/)
* [opera](https://www.opera.com)
* [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/)

within Windows.  Ensure that the privacy & security settings of the browsers are strict; additionally, set the default search engine to _duckduckgo_.
