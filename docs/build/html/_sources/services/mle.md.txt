# Machine Learning Engineering Services

## Focus

In brief:

<ul class="disc">
  <li class="disc"><b>Modelling</b>. Develop models in-line with model development best practices, including in-depth collaborations
    with domain experts, which ensures the development of well-informed models.</li>
  <li class="disc"><b>The Machine Learning Model Component of a Product</b>. Design, develop, and/or deploy machine learning components that are <b>(a)</b> in-line with software engineering, i.e., programming, best practices, <b>(b)</b> secure, <b>(c)</b> available, reliable, maintainable, and resilient, and <b>(d)</b> seamlessly integrate into the overarching product.  The development practices section will continuously outline best practices vis-Ã -vis the engineering aspects of model development.</li>
</ul>

## Service

In future, algorithms inquiries will be addressed via a services/inquiries management hub.  A future blog will include an introduction to the hub, and will outline how colleagues and clients can use it.  <b>Before proceeding</b> with a machine learning engineering service ascertain that it is a component of an in-progress project:

> That **(a)** addresses a business problem, **(b)** has an unambiguous problem statement, **\(c\)** has a deployment goal, **(d)** has a 
> machine learning model prediction/forecast/diagnostic aim, **(e)** is technologically feasible and economically viable.

Additionally, rigorously evaluate <b>(a)</b> model requirements, and <b>(b)</b> team capacity.

<br>

## Project Management

Each machine learning engineering project must have a project management hub within **(a)** JIRA, or **(b)** GitHub.
