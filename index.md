These pages continuously outline the data science team's operating practices vis-à-vis:

* Services
* Technologies & Development Practices

The pages ensure that we have the same understanding of the team's practices vis-à-vis **(a)** serving
clients, and **(b)** designing, developing, and deploying solutions.

These pages will be updated continuously, therefore each team member must study the pages regularly.
